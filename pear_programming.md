# Pair Programming
## A Primer

---

# What is it?
- 2 developers, writing code as a team
- Solving problems with communication

---

# What is it not?
- Looking at code together
- Looking over someones shoulder and telling them what to do
- One developer programming, one checking slack, phone, twitter

---

# How

---

# The Pairing Station
- 2 chairs
- 2 keyboards
- 2 mice
- 2 monitors
- 1 computer

---

# The Software
- An IDE both developers are comfortable with
- Screenhero if one is remote

---

# Techniques
- Pomodoro
- Ping Pong
- Natural flow

---

The key is to be deliberate - especially when starting. Try different styles and give feedback about which styles worked best. It should feel like a conversation.

---

# Rotation

- We’ve settled at Mavenlink on rotating every day
- Find a cadence that works for you

---

# Let the Jr Drive

---

This can be hard

---

- Sit on hands
- Turn keyboard around
- Unplug it even!

---

Remember: “Go slow to move fast” - Leveling up your pair helps everybody move fast in the end.

---

# Do it often

---

# Start consistently
- We set up a a pairing rotation each day at out daily standup
- Pairing starts promptly at 9:15 after standup

---

# Minimize distractions

---

# Have a plan
- “Today I’d like to focus on writing great tests”
- “I want to understand every line of code we write today”
- “I want to understand how JRuby makes anybodies life easier”

---

# Give feedback and receive feedback
- If you enjoyed the pairing session, let your pair know what went well e.g. “That was a really fun refactor”
- If it could have been better, explore with your pair what you think could have been improved e.g. “I could have communicated my ideas better before jumping ahead and I think I lost you”

---

# Take frequent breaks
- Drink a lot of water, it will remind you to take a break
- Take time for lunch
- Designate time to check email/slack

---

# Pairing schedule
- Rotate to break down silos
- “Clamor for work”
- If there is an area of code you haven’t seen yet be proactive about getting context on it

---

# A Note on Code Ownership
- Code owned by an individual does not get the benefit of being reviewed multiple eyes and hardened by multiple ideas
- Builds a dependency on code owner, which is not sustainable

---

# Why

---

# Creative Solutions

---

# Solving problems through communication
- Rubber Ducking (but with a person)
- Our ability to solve the right problem is constrained by our understanding of that problem (The code is the easy part)
- Two heads on the same problem will not only lead to better code but also better understanding of the reason why we are writing that code

---

# Increase focus
- How many times a day are you chiming in on various slack threads? Makes checking notifications deliberate and take time out of development.
- Often keeps the problem set small

---

# Share ideas
- You’ve been around the block and have a certain way of solving a particular problem.
- Having a second set of eyes, helps you approach the problem differently

---

# Code Quality

---

# Better code/less defects/less bugs
- Two sets of eyes, frequent rotation on projects
- More likely that one of the pair can spot a bug before it makes it to production

---

# Built in code review
- Rotation forces review of code early and often
- Constantly justifying the code you’re writing to your pair

---

# Share and be Accountable to your development practices and standards
- Propagate best practices
- New ideas can be shared 
- A pair can help maintain discipline e.g. “Let’s finish this refactor before we start a new one”

---

# Knowlege Distribution

---

# Context switching

---

# Knowledge transfer / Eliminate Silos
- Working on a feature that only James knows about? Have him pair with you and explain its inner workings.
- If you know something that hasn’t been socialized pair on it to share context with others

---

# Teaching/Personal Development
- Start training a new developer on day 1 by building features with them
- Since you’re paired, you don’t need to rush to get them credentials and teach them your process before they can be “productive”. Just start working.
- We don’t give our engineers their personal laptops until the end of the first week.

--- 

# “Move slow to move fast”
- Take the time to invest in your capacity to build software

---

# "Always Learning"
- The role of teacher and learner is fluid within a pairing session
- One minute teaching a new pattern or best practice the next learning a new shortcut or technique
= You may be surprised what you can learn from someone with far less experience
- Be ready to teach - but also be ready to learn
- It’s important to approach the pairing relationship as equals. Open your mind to the things that your pair has to share, even if you’re a grizzled senior

---

# How do I start?
- Make a pairing workstation
- Find a problem
- Find a pair
- Make a plan
- Write some code

---
